\title{clac_score_test calculates the score test for given expected value of genotype  for case and controls seperately (M1, M2)}
\usage{
calc_score_test1(M1, M2)
}
\arguments{
\item{M1:}{the expected value of genotype for case E(G_ij|D_ij) on one snp (dimension: ncase*1)}

\item{M2:}{the expected value of genotype for control E(G_ij|D_ij) on one snp (dimension: ncont*1)}
}
\value{
:the score test statistic calculated from M1 and M2 and empirical variance estimation seperated for case and controls.
T=S^2/var(S), for a given j, S_j=sum_i((Y_i-bar(Y))E(G_ij|D_ij))=sum_case(1-bar(Y))E(G|D)-sum_cont(bar(Y)E(G|D))
}

calc_score_test is called in \code{\link{test_regScore_perm}}
