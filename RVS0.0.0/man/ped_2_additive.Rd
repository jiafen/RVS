\title{ped_2_additive is to Combine two ped files for case and controls and transform them into additive coding}
\usage{
ped_2_additive(M1, M2, ncols)
}
\arguments{
\item{M1,}{the genotype data for the first sample (normally case)}

\item{M2,}{the genotype data for the secondsample (normally controls)}

\item{ncols,}{the number of column before the genotype data start}
}
\value{
A list including: Ad_all: the additive coding for all snps left, ncase: the first ncase rows are for cases;
 minor: the minor allele for each snp; rmed, the index of the removed snps from the input
}
\description{
This function remove snps that are missing in one sample, monomorphic in whole sample, monomorphic in each sample with diff alleles, non biallelic
 alternatively, we can use plink merge the two files and generate the additive coding with option --recodeA
 plink will also check the strand +/- and the major/minor alleles.
